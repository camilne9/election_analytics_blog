# Gov1347 Election Analytics
Welcome to my 2020 election analytics blog! I will be updating my blog weekly exploring the 2020 US presidential election. You can reach out to me at via email (christophermilne@college.harvard.edu).

## [Introduction](posts/Introduction.md)
This is my first blog post for Harvard's Gov1347: Election Analytics discussing swings in two party voting percentages in US presidential Elections. (9/13/2020)

## [Economy](posts/economy.md)
In this post I consider how RDI growth in the third quarter of an election year can be used to predict the two party vote share of the incumbent party. I consider how the predictions based on RDI growth differ for incumbent presidents and non-incumbent candidates as well as how predictions differ for elections from 1960-1988 and from 1992-2016.

## [Polls](posts/polling.md)
In this post I consider whether state level or national level polling is a better predictor for the US Presidential election by using state and national polling data for elections from 1972 to 2016. I then use state and national polling data to make a prediction for the 2020 presidential election. (9/27/2020)

## [Incumbency](posts/incumbency.md)
In this post I consider the effect of incumbency on US Presidential election. Specifically, I look at how increases in federal spending by state between election cycles affect the two-party popular vote results in those states.  (10/4/2020)

## [The Air Game](posts/air_game.md)
This post explores the effects of campaign spending on advertising on the US Presidential election. In particular, I use historical trends in how spending differences between parties in battleground states affects the result in those states and I use that to make a prediction about the 2020 election.
