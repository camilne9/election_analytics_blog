## Shocks: Covid-19

In this post we will consider how "shocks" can influence an election. A shock is an unforeseen event that can has the potential to influence the election. For the 2020 election cycle, the clearest example of a "shock" is Covid-19. In this post I will consider how the deaths due to coronavirus could impact the result of the 2020 presidential election.

In my previous post about the [air game](air_game.md), I made a state by state prediction based on **ad spending by the two major parties in the month of September** and whether states are **battleground states**. I will consider how **this prediction can be modified** by adjusting for the effect of coronavirus.


# Predictability

It is difficult to assign a weight to the effect of Coronavirus in terms of influencing how voters behave. There are a number of relevant considerations:

  1) Do voters attribute blame for the Coronavirus to politicians and poltical parties?
  2) Do voters associate the handling of Coronavirus more with Donald Trump and the Republican party, or with their Governor and therefore the party of their Governor?
  3) How does the magnitude of the effect of Coronavirus compare to the the two-party voting percentages predicted from ad spending?
  
It is difficult to make absolute declarations about the answers to these questions. For that reason I will consider how we'd expect the result of the election to look in a number of different scenarios based on these questions. 

First, for this post I will assume that the answer to the first questions is yes, that voters do blame politicians for the effects of coronavirus. In the case where the answer to this question is no, we would expect the prediction to default to [my previous prediction](air_game.md) so I would not need to change the prediction.

I will separately consider the two possible answers to the second question. I will make predictions both with the assumption that **credit or blame is assigned to Trump specifically** and with the assumption that **credit or blame is given to the party of the governor** of the state.

I will also consider two possible answers to the third question, which I will discuss below.

# Relative Performance

Data suggests that people tend to judge response to crisis on a **relative scale**. This means that we need to assess effectiveness of coronavirus response **relative to other states**. 

With that lens, there are two ways we can interpret how people assess how well their state is doing in terms of dealing with Covid-19. 

# Blaming the Governor
