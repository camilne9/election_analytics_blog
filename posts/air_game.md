## The Air Game

For the sake of this exploration I confine myself to money spent on advertising in the month of september. This is because this is advertising data closest to the election that I have access to. It has been argued that the effects of advertising are signgificant, but decay rapidly over time. Thus, restricting myself to only the advertising closest to the election (for which I have data) should be a fairly reasonable choice
