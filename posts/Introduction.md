## Introduction

For this post I worked with two data sets regarding the US presidential elections between 1948 and 2016. Using these data sets, I consider the swing in the two party vote share for the democrats between the 2008 and 2012 elections and between the 2000 and 2004 elections. 

For this exploration, the two party vote share considers the proportion of the popular vote for either major party (Democrat or Republican) that went to a given party. In using the two party vote share as a metric, we are disregarding votes that went to any candidate other than the two major party candidates. 

We can consider the change in the two party vote share held by the democrats and republicans between different presidential elections in the same state. In particular, we can consider how states change when voting for the an incumbent. In both 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama won the election and in both 2000 and 2004 George Bush won the election.

We can observe how the vote share changed for Obama:

We can also observe how the vote share changed for Bush:
