## Economy

In this post I explore the effect of the economy on the result of the US Presidential elections. In particular, I consider the effect of **growth of real disposable income** in the **third quarter** of an election year on the percentage of the two party vote share acquired by the incumbent party.

Additionally, I considered whether the impact of third quarter real disposable income growth had different impacts for candidates that were incumbent presidents seeking re-election and non-incumbent candidates of the incumbent party. I also considered whether the the election predictions based on different  

There is significant evidence that voters (often unknowingly) weight the most recent economy much more heavily than previous economic trends within the term of the sitting president. This effect happens even when voters intend to equally weight 

I chose to consider the economic indicator of *RDI (real disposable income)* rather than *GDP* because it seems that RDI would have a more noticeable impact on a voter's life. I also found that if I adjusted my model to use GDP it was less effect at accounting for the variation in the incumbent vote share than an RDI growth based model.
