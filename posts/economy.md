## Economy

# Explanation of Post

In this post I explore the effect of the economy on the result of the US Presidential elections. In particular, I consider the effect of **growth of real disposable income (RDI) in the third quarter of an election year** on the percentage of the **two party vote share acquired by the incumbent party**. The intention of this investigation is to use the linear trend supplied by this data to predict the two party vote share for Donald Trump in the upcoming 2020 election.

Beyond the regression generated by RDI growth, I considered whether the impact of 3rd quarter RDI growth had different impacts for candidates that were incumbent presidents seeking re-election and non-incumbent candidates of the incumbent party.

I also considered whether the election predictions differed if we only considered more recent elections or less recent elections. Since I had RDI growth data dating back to 1960, I define *"more recent"* and *"less recent"* elections such **elections from 1992 to 2016 are "more recent"** and **elections from 1960 to 1988 are "less recent"** to have roughly even subsets of the data in each category.


# Motivation for Model

There is significant evidence that voters (often unknowingly) weight the most recent economy much more heavily than previous economic trends within the term of the sitting president. This effect happens even when voters intend to equally weight the entire scope of the previous presidential term. To account for this recency bias, I consider 3rd quarter data because that is the most recent economy data available to the electorate at the time of the election.

I chose to consider the economic indicator of **RDI (real disposable income)** rather than other possible indicators such as *GDP* because it seems that RDI would have a more noticeable impact on a voter's life. (I also found that if I adjusted my model to use GDP it was less effect at accounting for the variation in the incumbent vote share than an RDI growth based model as evidenced by its lesser r-squared value for its regression line.)

# Prediction

We can consider the proportion of the two party vote share we expect Donald Trump to get based on these models.
